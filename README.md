#A Graph-based dependency parser using Deep Learning
DeepParser is a graph-based dependency parser based on deep learning model. This work has been accepted by ACL2015 as oral long paper. <br>

##Project structures
model: Trained model for English parser and Chinese Parser <br>
data: Sample dependency data and trained word embeddings (via word2vec) <br>
src: Codes for our three models <br>

##Training and Testing
For compiling training code: <br>
make dep_parser_train <br>
<br>
For compiling testing code: <br>
make dep_parser_test <br>
